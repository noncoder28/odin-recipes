    <p>This is a recipe I came up with when I was helping to raise 6 kids. 
       Every penny counted. You can add onions if desired.

    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pint sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,
